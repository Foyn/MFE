just test the performance of ensemble learnign when encountering unstructured data.
we only use some simple base classifiers to test.
but we set the number of base classifier to a big number (e.g. 100)
no more complex base classifiers are need for ensemble learning.
dataset: chose 2 class from mini-imagenet.
